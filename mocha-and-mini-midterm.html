                    <p>Mocha is a small, brown-striped tabby cat, being only a year old. She usually does play with the other cats quite a bit, but she usually likes to sleep more, her favourite food to eat is strictly canned and dried cat food, she'll almost never eat the food that we make for ourselves. She is also very friendly towards me, she enjoys my company, and loves to sleep on my bed as well! What Mocha would usually do in a day would be sleeping until it's almost ten in the morning, then she would do her daily walk-around-the-house until she finds something interesting, which she hasn't, yet. </p>

                <div>
                    <p>The next part of her morning is she'll try to get outside, but after a bit, she immediately wants to come back in, no matter what the weather is like outside, she was never much of an outside cat, she loves to enjoy the cozy inside of our house! Whenever she's hungry she will go downstairs (where we keep all of our food) and eat the canned and dry cat food, this is the only kind of food she likes, she was never really a fan of human food. After everything on her daily schedule has been marked off, she immediately finds someones' bed to sleep on, and it's goodnight!</p>

                    <p>Mini is basically the child of this group, as she is the smallest and the youngest, even though she has grown quite fast over the past month, she is an orange cat, and a white patch is located on the stomach area. She doesn't go outside at all because she is still too young to go out at all, but she does like to walk around the house and discover anything that she hasn't yet discovered! We still haven't fully studied her, but so far, there are some things that Mini does commonly in a day is to wake up early in the morning, she doesn't really sleep a lot, but she likes to lie down with her hands and feet tucked in, just like her sister Gingy.</p>

                <div>
                    <p>We don't let her go outside yet because she is still too young, even if she were to follow one of the other cats, we think it's best to keep her inside until she gets bigger enough. Despite not being able to go outside, she is still very adventurous inside, she'll find many small spaces to live under, to find spots where not even the other cats have discovered yet! This cat, unlike Mocha, LOVES to eat human food, in fact, she is very annoying about it, whenever we sit down to eat literally anything, she'll always jump up to the table and try to get a taste, after she eats, and plays a bit more, she finds a nice big bed, like my parents, and it's off to hit the hay!</p>
