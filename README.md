## Welcome to my Website!

### What is this?

This is a website that I have created for myself and as a Final Integrated Project for IDP!

### What's it called?

Cat Group!

### What is it about?

It's about my four cats I own at home, similar to a blog.

### What does it feature?

It describes my cats and what they usually do on a daily basis.

### How does it look?

It looks great! It features a Green and very light grey colour scheme, with some hints of 
Orange, Brown and Dark Grey to show off the colours of my cats.

### How much content is there?

Not a crazy ammount, but on the first page, there are two paragraphs in total, one talking 
about who I am, and what I do. And the second one partially introduces all four of the 
cats. The other two pages includes four paragraphs per page, each two fully talking about 
the cats, and what they do on a daily basis. I don't really want to spoil much, because 
I'll need you to read the content and see for yourself what my website contains!
