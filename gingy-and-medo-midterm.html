                    <p>Gingy may not the oldest, but is the largest cat out of all four of them, she is related to Mini and we would know because they come from the same farm and the same mom. She is very much an outdoor cat, whenever she isn't outside for more than five minutes, she begs us to let her out, even at night, not to mention she only eats food, no matter what kind outside. You also better be careful with her, as she enjoys hunting down small animals such as birds and mice, and has done it twice! Gingy and Mini are quite similar, not only because they are sisters, but because they usually act the same, they both love eating our food, but because they are very adventurous, but we are now talking about Gingy, you'll get to see Mini later!</p>

                <div>
                    <p> Gingy loves to sleep, but mostly on computer chairs, probably because they only have room for one cat, that cat being Gingy, obviously. After a good morning rest, she immediately goes rushing towards the door, and keeps meowing until we let her out, she is the biggest outdoor cat out of the other three, she'll do anything in the outdoors, she likes to run around, find small spaces to live in, and even try to hunt small animals, which we previously mentioned that she once hunted a small bird, and a rat. After frolicking outside for possibly hours, she decides to come back in, and immediately go to sleep, back on the chair she goes!</p>

                    <p>Medo is the oldest cat, but only the second-largest, as she doesn't really do much other than sit around. she is a grey cat with the softest fur out of the other cats, which makes it nice to pet her, but not for long, as doesn't really like being touched that much when she is sitting down, she won't hurt you, but she'll get out and find somewhere more peaceful. She will go outside, but she mainly hangs out at the front of the house, maybe she likes to feel like she is protecting us from anything bad! Medo is the most calming cat out of the others, she likes to sleep alone half of the time, the other half is her sleeping in my parents' bed with Mini, she likes to give the other cats some company as well.</p>

                <div>
                    <p> After a mornings' rest, she'll go down to the living room, and lie down on top of the couch, and look outside the window. After glaring outside for a bit, she decides that it is also time for her to go outside, she likes to be outside usually by herself, but sometimes she will often go to the neighbours' cat and play with them. After being outside for quite a while (she'll usually be out for 8 hours on average) she will go inside and find some food to eat, Medo likes to eat a combination of our food and cat food, it doesn't matter what she is eating most of the time. When she has finished eating, it's time to find a spot to sleep, which is usually on the couch or in my parents' bedroom, and it's goodnight for Medo!</p>
