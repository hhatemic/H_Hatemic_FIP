                    <p>My name is Hamza Hatemic, I am 17 years old, soon to be 18, and I've always wanted to make a website dedicated to my cats because I thought it would be fun to show them to the world! My main hobbies are nothing special, just sitting around, playing video games, and hanging out with my cats! I honestly don't know how I lived my life, or how my future would be without living with my cats, they are just the perfect pet!</p>

                    <p>Here we have the four stars of the show, Gingy, Medo, Mocha, and Mini! Gingy is the bigger Orange cat who loves to go outside and chase anything that moves! She is the second oldest and the biggest out of the other three. Next, we have Medo, she is the oldest, but the second largest, she looks smaller for her age being 1-and-a-half years old, and she usually likes to be alone. Mocha, the little brown-striped tabby that is very passionate, and likes to sleep a lot. Last but not least, Mini, the youngest and smallest kitten, her and gingy both came from the same farm we got them from, so they are both related.</p>
